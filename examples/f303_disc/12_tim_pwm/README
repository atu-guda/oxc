Test TIM8 as PWM output
out: C6, C7, C8, C9 (CH3,4),
PREpere:
may be (reserver) + C6: tick for usonic sensor, C7 - input from sensor

user vars:
 p - prescaler
 a - ARR
 r - flag: 1: row CCR values 0: in % to ARR
 t - unused
T val1 val2 val3 val4

Attension: TIM inner input clock is 2 * PLL = 144 MHz
if  PeriphClkInit.Tim1ClockSelection   = RCC_TIM1CLK_PLLCLK; in clockconfig

For servo:
 p = PSC = 143 -> freq1 = 1MHz
 a = ARR = 9999 -> freq2 = 100Hz (10 ms)
 so values in 'T' command is in microseconds,
  typicaly 500 -- 2500 (may vary)

Using  UART as console via SmallRL.
Used USART2 with FT232RL-alike board.

PA2  = USART2_TX
PA3  = USART2_RX
