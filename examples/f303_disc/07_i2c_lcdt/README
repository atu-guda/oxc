Control HD44780 LCD display via i2c port expander PCF8574
Use "test" command to send string, on/off display

-------------------------- BEWARE! ------------------------------
On STM32F3Discovery board accelerometer + compas LSD303DLHC
is connected to I2C1. It is ***NOT*** 5V tolerant.
PCF8574 works with 3.3v, but HD44780 requires 5V.
So you seed 5/3.3V I2C converter not to froast accel.

SCL = B6 + 10k pullUp on board
SDA = B7 + 10k pullUp on board

Used USART2 with USB-UART board.
A2  = USART2_TX
A3  = USART2_RX
