Test TIM8 as PWM output
out: I5,6,7,2
user vars:
 p - prescaler
 a - ARR
 r - flag: 1: row CCR values 0: in % to ARR
 t - unused
 m - mode 0: up 1: down 2: center1 3: center2 4: center3
 o - polarity: 0: HIGH 1: LOW
T val1 val2 val3 val4

Attension: TIM inner input clock is 2 * APB2 = 168 MHz

For servo:
 p = PSC = 167 -> freq1 = 1MHz
 a = ARR = 9999 -> freq2 = 100Hz (10 ms)
 so values in 'T' command is in microseconds,
  typicaly 500 -- 2500 (may vary)
