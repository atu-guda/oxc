Test TIM9 as PWM output
out: E5, E6 - ony 2 channels
user vars:
 p - prescaler
 a - ARR
 r - flag: 1: row CCR values 0: in % to ARR
 t - unused
T val1 val2 [ val3 val4 ]

Attention: TIM inner input clock is 2 * APB2 = 192 MHz

For servo:
 p = PSC = 167 -> freq1 = 1MHz
 a = ARR = 9999 -> freq2 = 100Hz (10 ms)
 so values in 'T' command is in microseconds,
  typicaly 500 -- 2500 (may vary)

A10  = USART2_TX
A11  = USART2_RX
