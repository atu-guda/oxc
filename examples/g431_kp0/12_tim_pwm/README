Test TIM2 as PWM output
out: A0 - A3
user vars:
 p - prescaler
 a - ARR
 r - flag: 1: row CCR values 0: in % to ARR
 t - unused
T val1 val2 val3 val4


For servo:
 p = PSC = 143 -> freq1 = 1MHz
 a = ARR = 9999 -> freq2 = 100Hz (10 ms)
 so values in 'T' command is in microseconds,
  typicaly 500 -- 2500 (may vary)
