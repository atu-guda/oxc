Test MAX31855 thermocouple drv via SPI
And output both via console and LCD screen + screen menu

Used: SPI1:
A4 = SNSS
A5 = SCK
A5 = MISO
A7 = MOSI

A0:A3 to ground, need (internal?) pull-up
Output via HD44780 LCD display via i2c port expander PCF8574

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Check for 5V tolerantness
PCF8574 works with 3.3v, but HD44780 requires 5V.
So you seed 5/3.3V I2C converter not to froast something.

SCL = B6 + 10k pullUp on board
SDA = B7 + 10k pullUp on board
